# Vanessa Yau's AJ Bell test

This repo is my attempt of the front end practical assessment.

It uses Next.js and React with pnpm, with Typescript and RTL/Jest for testing. MaterialUI was used for the CSS/components, to take advantage of the existing data components provided by the library. SCSS was also added for additional custom styles that could be added on top of MaterialUI components.

### Improvements:
- Get localstorage working
- Finish off unit tests for table
- Improvements on design (get fonts working)
- Fix typescript errors


## To Run:
(if PNPM isn't installed)
```
npm install pnpm
```
```
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```
